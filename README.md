# Topofilter: a Topographic Filtering Model
Topofilter computes delivery and storage of field-derived sediment according to its spatial and structural connectivity to the stream channel network; subsequently, delivery of both field- and near-channel-derived sediment along with floodplain storage are computed in the stream channel network to the watershed outlet. The model outputs provide spatially rich representation of sediment delivery and storage on field and along the stream that is consistent with available independent information on sediment accumulations and fluxes. 

The files consist of MATLAB code*, along with MATLAB workspaces, containing input variables for Topofilter, for nested watersheds, used to simulate sediment delivery in the Le Sueur River Basin. 

The manuscript is currently under review and doi citation site will be ready when the publication process is complete.
